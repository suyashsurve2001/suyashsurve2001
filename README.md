### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is  Suyash Surve, and I'm a passionate data analyst based in Thane. I love using data to solve problems and make informed decisions.

When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me hitting the trails and going for bike rides in the mountains. I believe that staying active and spending time in nature is key to maintaining a healthy body and mind.

I'm still a fresher in the field, but I have experience using Python, MySQL, Power BI, Excel, and Streamlit. I'm always eager to learn new skills and technologies to enhance my data analysis capabilities.

In the past, I've also worked as a Wix developer, building websites for clients. This experience has given me valuable skills in web development and design.

My GitHub profile is where I showcase some of my best work, including data analysis projects and contributions to open source projects. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other developers and learn from their expertise.

Thanks for stopping by my profile, and feel free to connect with me to discuss all things data analysis, web development, or mountain biking!
